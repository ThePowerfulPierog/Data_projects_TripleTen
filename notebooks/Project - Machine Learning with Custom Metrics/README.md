In this scenario, our goal is to build a prototype of a machine learning model for a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.
Our model will predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore using data on extraction and purification. The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

Specifically, in this project we advanced our Machine Learning skills by locating missing values in other files, defining functions to evaluate custom metrics, and defining functions that use those previous functions to analyze entire models.
