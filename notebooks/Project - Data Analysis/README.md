Our first project showcases Data Analysis skills, with a basic use of statistics.  In this scenario we work for the online store which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available in our CSV. Specifically, our goal is to explore the impact that certain features have on the success of a game.  Features such as console, region, and genre may all influence the popularity of a game.  Certain types of games and certain consoles may be more popular in certain geographical areas.  In this scenario, our analysis could help drive decisions behind marketing campaigns.
