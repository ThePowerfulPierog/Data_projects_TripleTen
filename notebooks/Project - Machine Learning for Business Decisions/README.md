skills developed: Machine Learning, working with imbalance classes, hyperparameter tuning

In this project, we work for a bank with a major problem: customers are leaving little by little. Our goal is to build a model that predicts whether or not a customer will leave the bank soon. 
Our CSV contains data on clientsâ€™ past behavior and termination of contracts with the bank. We aim for an F1 score of at least 0.59. We'll also examine the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1.
